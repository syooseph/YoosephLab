This is an implementation of the MS_MixMPLN algorithm as described in the paper
Variational Approximation-based Model Selection for Microbial Network Inference
by Yooseph and Tavakoli


The sample-taxa count matrix can be provided to the function
best_model either as an R matrix using the variable X or it can be
read from a csv file using the variable F. Only one of X or F is
needed in the function call.

n: #samples
d: #taxa
K: #component distributions in the mixture model
beta, v, and V are the priors used in the model (see paper)

Program call to function best_model
Options:
X: the dxn sample-taxa matrix
F: csv file with n+1 lines and d columns; the first line (header) is ignored
beta: prior for the Gaussian distribution for mu_l
v, V: priors for the Wishart distribution for Omega_l
niter: max #iterations for the EM algorithm
start: #starting random starting points for the EM algorithm


Program usage example:
source("MS_MixMPLN.R")
Result = best_model(F="example/example_d50_graph_band_K2.csv",K=4,beta=1e-6,v=50,V=51*diag(50),niter=30,start=25))

Result is an R object that contains a set of information related to
the variational parameters and the mixing coefficient
estimates. Result$Pi returns the vector of mixing coefficients.
